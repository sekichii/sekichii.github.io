        <h3><span class="double_slash">//</span>bot development services</h3>
        <p>I offer <span class="highlight">bot development services</span> for both <span class="highlight">discord and telegram</span>, offering a wide range of services to meet your needs! I can tailor the bot to your specific needs, ensuring it meets your unique requirements. I also provide ongoing <span class="highlight">maintenance and support</span> to ensure your bot is always up-to-date and running smoothly. I also can help with <span class="highlight">web development</span> for your bot or even just a portfolio site!</p>
        <h3><span class="double_slash">//</span>why pick me?</h3>
        <p>Here are a few reasons <span class="highlight">why you should choose me</span> for your bot development needs:</p>

        <h3><span class="double_slash">//</span>flexibility <span class="gray-text">- does what it needs to do</span></h3>
        <p>I always focus on <span class="highlight">flexibility</span> and <span class="highlight">customization</span> to ensure your bot meets your needs. I take my time discussing with a person what a bot <span class="highlight">should do</span> and how it <span class="highlight">should look</span>, so please think about what you want your bot to do and how you want it to look <span class="highlight">in advance.</span></p>

        <h3>Here is what you should think about in advance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What specific tasks or problems your bot <span class="highlight">should solve</span></li>
            <li>Any unique <span class="highlight">visual elements</span> or interaction patterns</li>
            <li>Any <span class="highlight">additional features</span> or functionality you want to have</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="double_slash">//</span>customization <span class="gray-text">- tailored to your very needs</span></h3>
        <p>Beyond just making your bot flexible, I focus on truly <span class="highlight">customizing</span> it to match your server's tone <span class="highlight">perfectly</span> - whether that's chill, super active, or something else! This means that I take <span class="highlight">a lot of time</span> ensuring your bot's presence (if it has one!) and how it communicates feels <span class="highlight">right at home</span> with your server's aesthetic. Your bot will be truly customized to feel like a <span class="highlight">natural part</span> of your Discord server!</p>

        <h3>What this means for you?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I might ask a few questions about the <span class="highlight">general theme</span> and <span class="highlight">tone</span> of your server</li>
            <li>I could also ask about any <span class="highlight">unique features</span> or <span class="highlight">interaction patterns</span> that you want to have</li>

        <h3><span class="double_slash">//</span>polish <span class="gray-text">- no extra unnecessary code left</span></h3>
        <p>An amazing bot isn't just about what it does; it's also about <span class="highlight">how well it's built</span> and <span class="highlight">how it's coded</span>. I take a meticulous approach to <span class="highlight">cleanliness</span> and <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> when it comes to coding behind the scenes! My commitment to polish means I deliver a bot that's not just functional, but also super <span class="highlight">clean</span>, <span class="highlight">efficient</span>, and <span class="highlight">reliable</span>. This means <span class="highlight">tidying up</span> the code, testing everything thoroughly, and <span class="highlight">removing any extra bits</span> that could slow it down or cause hiccups later.</p>

        <h3>For people who are interested in what I use:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For telegram, I use Python with the <span class="highlight">python-telegram-bot</span> library</li>
            <li>For discord, I use Python with the <span class="highlight">nextcord</span> library</li>
